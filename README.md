# Quotex Trading App: Is It Real or Fake? A Comprehensive Review for Indian Traders

Quotex is an unregulated, offshore binary options platform that lets you
trade over 200 assets across various financial instruments, including
commodities, crypto, stocks, and currency pairs. The broker is focusing
on beginner traders and claims to be an "Innovative platform for smart
investments" with the promise of easy profits, while "making online
trading comfortable and safe".

## But as we show you in this review, \*\*Quotex is not innovative,\*\* \*\*it is not easy to make money on their platform and it is definitely not safe.\*\* Let\'s see why.

## Quick Facts about Quotex

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

-   The platform was launched in 2019 and is currently owned by ON SPOT
    LLC GROUP, a company based in St. Kitts and Nevis.
-   \*\*Quotex is available in most countries\*\* around the world,
    \*\*including South Africa,\*\* Asia and South America, but it is
    not available in the USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel, Russia and
    in most European countries.
-   The broker has over 29 million active traders worldwide.
-   Quotex has over 210.000 affiliates that earn over \$5 million in
    affiliate revenue weekly.
-   The minimum deposit is \$10 and Quotex offers a \$10.000 demo
    account.

    according to them.

## Based on the above facts, you could think that Quotex is an established broker, but before you open an account with them, let\'s analyse how safe the broker is.

## Is Quotex a Scam?

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-- \*\*Yes, we believe that Quotex is a
scam\*\* \*\*and you should not open an account with them.\*\* Their
trading platform, trading tools and service agreement are designed to
make traders lose money in the long run. \*\*Quotex is not regulated by
any financial authorities\*\* \*\*so it is not a safe and legit
broker\*\* and nobody is protecting traders\' interest against shady,
unfair business practices.  \*\*Hint: we suggest you to trade on more
trustworthy platforms like\*\* \[\*\*Olymp
Trade\*\*\](https://eseta.org.za/go/olymptrade/quotex-cross/
"Olymptrade - Quotex cross") \*\*or\*\*
\[\*\*Exness\*\*\](https://eseta.org.za/exness/)\*\*.

## Let\'s take a closer look on some of our strong arguments why we think that Quotex is not a safe broker.

### 1. Not regulated at all

Quotex is based in St. Kitts and Nevis where there is no regulatory
framework for online trading brokers. This means that Quotex is not
licenced and overseen by any financial authorities and does not offer
any form of investor protection, such as compensation funds, negative
balance protections, and client fund segregation. Quotex is included in
the scam warning lists of several regulatory authorities like the
International Financial Commission, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the
Portuguese Securities Market Commission (CMVM) and the Italian CONSOB.

warning"=""}

### 2. It\'s easy to lose money while trading at Quotex

Quotex exclusively offers binary options trading (fixed time trading as
they call it), a high-risk high-reward trading type that makes trading
very exciting, but also very risky. It\'s very hard to be profitable at
binary options trading, even for experienced traders, because assets
price movements are almost unpredictable in such short timeframes.
Quotex does not offer other trading instruments, such as CFDs or
traditional stocks, where traders could open longer trades, choose
leverage levels, and set stop-loss and take-profit levels according to
their personal risk tolerance.

### 3. Misleading marketing tactics and trading tools

Quotex uses misleading marketing tactics and questionable trading
practices that make potential traders believe that they can make easy
and guaranteed money on their platform. Here are a few examples we found
of such unethical business practices:

#### Trading signals with 87% accuracy

Quotex advertises that it provides trading signals with an 87% accuracy
rate, which is very unrealistic, especially in fixed time trading. The
broker does not provide any explanation of how these signals are
generated or verified. Quotex suggests that traders can make easy
profits by following these signals, but it\'s doubtful that these
signals result from actual advanced technical analysis and not just
generated randomly.  \*\*When we tested the signals of Quotex, we had a
45% success rate,\*\* which means that we lost money by following the
signals.

#### Shady Deposit Bonus Terms

\[Quotex offers promo codes and deposit
bonuses\](https://eseta.org.za/quotex/promo-code/) to new traders, but
hides important conditions from them. According to the Quotex service
agreement, "\_these bonuses\_ \*\*\_are subject to specific
terms\_\*\* \_and conditions" and "funds credited as bonuses\_
\*\*\_are not directly withdrawable.\_\*\* \_When a client performs
trading operations,\_ \*\*\_the funds they deposited are used
first,\_\*\* \_and only after these are exhausted can the bonus funds be
utilized for further operations."\_   Brokers often use such terms to
prevent withdrawals and lock traders\' funds in the platform.

#### Quotex "guaranteed winning" strategies

Quotex mainly became famous because of the hundreds of YouTube videos
discussing "secret trading tricks", "always winning
strategies", and "guaranteed profits", created by Quotex
affiliates. We understand that these claims are coming from Quotex
affiliates and not from the broker directly, but as we explained in our
\[Quotex affiliate program
overview\](https://eseta.org.za/quotex/affiliate-program/) article, the
broker does not control or sanction misleading promises. We think that
a responsible trading platform should punish affiliates who use such
scammy promotional methods, just like \[Olymp
Trade\](https://eseta.org.za/go/olymptrade/quotex-cross/
"Olymptrade - Quotex cross") or \[IQ
Option\](https://eseta.org.za/iq-option/) are doing.

### 4. Bad reputation, many negative user reviews

Quotex receives many negative reviews about the difficulty in money
withdrawals, \[blocked trading
accounts\](https://eseta.org.za/quotex/blocked-account/) for made-up
reasons and bad customer service from its users complaining on Reddit,
Trustpilot, and other credible review platforms.  Here are Quotex
